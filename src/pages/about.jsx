With over 2 years of professional experience at Walmart Global Tech, I played a pivotal role in developing scalable software solutions that significantly impacted the company's success.

        I look forward to giving back to the community in any way possible. I've conducted workshops, mentored students (GHC'23 OSD mentor), and even instructed engineering jargon to a 40-member PM cohort resulting in a 15% efficacy boost in PM-Engineer conversations as part of my community initiatives. I am happy to mentor as well as learn from others.
